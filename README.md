<h3 align="center">About Project</h3>
<p align="left">
This project has some objectives such as applying stats concepts, feature engineering, Data Mining, and other Data Science techniques. 

In the first step, was made a superficial analysis of the dataset, checking the values and type of variables to apply the correct processing of data. The second step was to understand the patterns and the correlations between the variables. In addition, search for some strategies to fill the null values presents on the data.

Another goal was to show my skills in Python language, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. Furthermore, apply my studies of statistics and probability distributions. Another objective was to try to build analysis and broadcast the results in English, to aim to get a better performance in this language.
